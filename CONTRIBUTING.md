# Contributing to Combine

Want to hack on Combine? Awesome! Here are instructions to get you started.
They are  not perfect. Please let us know if anything feels wrong or
incomplete. We based these on the excellent [Docker contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Topics

* [Reporting Security Issues](#reporting-security-issues)
* [Design and Cleanup Proposals](#design-and-cleanup-proposals)
* [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)
* [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines)
* [Community Guidelines](#Combine-community-guidelines)

## Reporting Security Issues

The Combine maintainers take security very seriously. If you discover a
security issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

_this needs review and planning_

Please send your report privately to [security@Combine.com](mailto:security@Combine.com),
please **DO NOT** file a public issue.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it.
We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it
out in the future.

## Design and Cleanup Proposals

When considering a design proposal, we are looking for:

* A description of the problem this design proposal solves
* A pull request, not an issue, that modifies the documentation describing
  the feature you are proposing, adding new documentation if necessary.
  * Please prefix your issue with `Proposal:` in the title
* Please review [the existing Proposals](https://github.com/Combine/Combine/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AProposal)
  before reporting a new one. You can always pair with someone if you both
  have the same idea.

When considering a cleanup task, we are looking for:

* A description of the refactors made
  * Please note any logic changes if necessary
* A pull request with the code
  * Please prefix the title of your PR with `Cleanup:` so we can quickly
    address it.
  * Your pull request must remain up to date with master, so rebase as
    necessary.

## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

When reporting [issues](https://github.com/Combine/Combine/issues) on GitHub,
please include your host OS (Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 19, etc) and version of
Python (from `python -V`).

Please also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable.  This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Contribution guidelines

### Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests. We do our best to process them
as quickly as possible. You're not sure if that typo is worth a pull request?
Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged!
If there's a problem with the implementation, we will provide feedback on what
to improve.

We're trying very hard to keep Combine lean and focused. We don't want it to do
everything for everybody. This means that we might decide against incorporating
a new feature. However, there might be a way to implement that feature
*on top of* Combine.

### Create issues...

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/Combine/Combine/issues) before anybody
starts working on it.

### ...but check for existing issues first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting
your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a
quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most
common problems and requests.

### Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bug fix branch, name it iXXXX-something where XXXX is the number of
  the issue.
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your
  intentions and name it iXXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the issue.

Update the documentation when creating or modifying features. Review your
documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness.

Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading,
and maintenance. Always run `pep8 file.py` on each changed file before
committing your changes. Most editors have plug-ins that do this automatically.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a
reference to all the issues that they address.

Commit messages should start with a short summary (max. 50 chars) written in
the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which
is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the
suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Be
sure to post a comment after pushing. The new commits will show up in the pull
request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you
comment.

Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of master without multiple
branches mixed into the PR.

**Git tip**: If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use `rebase master` in your
feature branch to update your pull request rather than `merge master`.

Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into
logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. After every
commit the test suite should be passing. Include documentation changes in the
same commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like
`Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX`, which will automatically close the
issue when merged.

### Merge approval

Combine maintainers use :+1: or :shipit: in comments on the code review to
indicate acceptance. Once it's approved, the maintainers will handle merging
into master.

### Accept the CLA

_insert instructions about CLA from Alex_

## Combine Community Guidelines

We want to keep the Combine community awesome, growing and collaborative. We
need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some
general guidelines for the community as a whole:

* Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no
  regional, racial, gender, orientation, or other abuse will be tolerated. We
  like nice people way better than mean ones!

* Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community
  feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their
  contributions. Do everything possible to encourage participation in
  our community.

* Keep it legal: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that
  you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the
  law.

* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct repository
  and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or
  respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of
  people.  Please consider this before you update.  Also remember that
  nobody likes spam.

### Guideline Violations â€” 3 Strikes Method

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we
do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.

1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the
   behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.

2. Second occurrence: We will send you a private message with a warning that
   any additional violations will result in removal from the community.

3. Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we may need to delete or ban
   your account.

**Notes:**

* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don't do this, we'll
  have spam all over the place.

* Violations are forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won't hold a
  grudge. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes.

* People who commit minor infractions will get some education, rather than
  hammering them in the 3 strikes process.

* The rules apply equally to everyone in the community, no matter how much
  you've contributed.

* Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature
  will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes or
  forgiveness.

* Contact _who?!_ to report abuse or appeal violations. In the case of appeals,
  we know that mistakes happen, and we'll work with you to come up with a fair
  solution if there has been a misunderstanding.
